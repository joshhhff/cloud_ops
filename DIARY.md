### Progress
- Implemented CRUD for Locations (Delete operation pending)
- Integrated Record controller (`record.create`) and `RecordObject` methods (`record.setValue`, `record.save`, etc.) for data interactions

### Next Steps
1. Develop WMS components:
    - CRUD for Zones, Aisles, and Bins
2. Set up Inventory Management after WMS is complete
3. Begin work on Transactions and Fulfillment once Inventory Management is in place
